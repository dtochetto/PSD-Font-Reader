PSD-Font-Reader
===============

A mac application for reading fonts from PSD Files.

![screenshot with fonts](https://raw.github.com/schlu/PSD-Font-Reader/master/screenshot/screen_with_fonts.png)

Open a PSD file and browse the fonts in a table view or in an outline view, based on layer names.


## Disclaimer

I am an iOS programmer, not a mac programmer. I use this application to get font information out of psd files that I get from designers. This code should not be considered production quality, it is an internal devtool I use in my workflow. 

At this time layer styles are not supported, so color information may be wrong.

## Credit

This app wouldn't be possible without the [FMPSD](https://github.com/ccgus/fmpsd) library for reading PSD files written by Gus Mueller from [Flying Meat](http://flyingmeat.com/).

## Future

I really don't know where this app will go in the future. I will happily consider pull requests or feature requests.
